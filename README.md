Binary Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Wavelet Mutation
=============

Source code for the research relates to paper / journal: "Binary Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with Wavelet Mutation".
In this research, we will compare our new method "Binary HPSOWM" with Binary GA and Binary PSO using many nonlinear test functions

This research is the work of:
- TRAN Quang Anh
- HA Quang Minh
- DANG Dinh Quan
- Frank Jiang

The code was originally written in Perl, but then converted to Scala.

The manual will be updated later.
