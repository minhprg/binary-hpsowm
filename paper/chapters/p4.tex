In this paper, we adapt the idea HPSOWM to build a binary version - BHPSOWM. This transforms the approach from a continuous problem into a discrete problem. The proposed approach is then used to compare with other two binary algorithms: GA and BPSO. We conducted an experiment using 18 benchmark functions that falls into three main categories (unimodal, multimodal few local minima, multimodal many local minima), using the same parameters from previous research of HPSOWM and BPSO. The result proves the preservation of the advantages of HPSOWM in providing good and stable solutions with steady convergence rate and small standard deviation among all tests. It also showed that BHPSOWM outperformed GA and BPSO in 9/18 functions, has the same performance in 5/18 functions and be a runner-up in the rest 4 functions.

However, even providing better goodness and stability, the convergence rate of BHPSOWM is slower than GA and BPSO, this is also the inspiration for us to work in the future researches.
